1) For path length = 0., CNTNM.OPTDPT files produce NaN's

2) WATER.COEF files are independent of path length
3) WATER.COEF files are independent of vmr
4) WATER.COEF files are independent of pressure

5) WATER.COEF files are *not* independent of T
   -> also doesn't scale as ~1/T, instead something that looks more complicated [?]
   -> foreign broadening coef (without radiation field) *is* independent of T [?]


6) when I recompile the source code without N2,CO2, etc.
   the WATER.COEF files don't change!
   -> species are only used to compute optical thickness?


7) To use an input file do:

   INPUT NEEDS TO BE LINE SEPARATED (p/T/dz/vmr H2O), e.g.,
   ---
   1000.
   300.
   0.0
   0.01
   ---

   AND THEN run "./cntnm.exe < INPUT"

==============

To use in my radiation code, need a wrapper that can pass in relevant T (and p?),
gets coefficients from that, and then scales them to get kappa?

OR:
make a wrapper that converts my inputs into the right molecular amounts, i.e.,
path length (of total air?) and H2O VMR, and then reads from the optical depth file.

-------
TO DO:
test my code by computing optical depth from the WATER.COEF file,
and then compare with the CNTNM.OPTDPT file.
